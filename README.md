# Project One - Data Parser
A small data parser for high-scores in FFXIV's POTD.

Outputs the player data from the POTD high-scores website into a table using SQL

### MVP:
- ALL user interaction must come purely from the console application
- Hive/MapReduce must:
    - scrap data from datasets from an API based on your topic of choice
- Your console application must:
    - query data to answer at least 6 analysis questions of your choice
    - have a login system for all users with passwords
        - 2 types of users: BASIC and ADMIN
        - Users should also be able to update username and password
- implement all CRUD operations
- can use hive with screenshots but make as program in 
    IntelliJ (or VSCode) too with appropriate dependencies

### Stretch Goals:
- Passwords must be encrypted
- Export all results into a JSON file/ can optional because(changes done)

### Presentations
- Run an analysis using the console application.


### Technologies
- Hadoop MapReduce
- YARN(by default) 
- HDFS
